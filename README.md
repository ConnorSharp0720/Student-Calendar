## What
This was a project for my Human Computer Interaction Course (HCI) my sophomore year. Me and my group set out to create a scheduling application 
that would identify gaps in your day to day schedule and tell you when you should do things like homework and errands. The idea was that some plans were 
concrete and had specific times such as meetings or classes, but other tasks such as studying and grocery shopping were more flexible and as long as you
had enough time to complete them, you could place them anywhere. This application was one of the first full feature Java Apps that I worked on. While there
are a few features we didn't complete, we still made a decent schedulng app that was fun to use.
